  Layer: Consensus (soft fork)
  Title: BOLO Checkpoint on external blockchain
  Author: Brian Burrell &lt; support@neo-natura.com &gt;
  Status: Proposed
  Type: Standards Track
  Created: 2018-11-26</pre>
==Abstract== 
This SIP describes a method to establish a new dynamic checkpoint
on the Shioncoin blockchain by creating a "notarized
transaction" on an external blockchain. The external blockchain
intended for use is litecoin. In other words, the "BOLO"
system notarizes blocks on the Shioncoin blockchain by creating a
special transaction on the litecoin blockchain. 

==Motivation== 
A notarized transaction, or a transaction signed by independant
users who participate in the Shioncoin ecosystem, provides a method
to create a consensus about a particular blockchain and a means to
declare it as the official branch. This is only possible if at least
11 participants are in agreement about the current blockchain
hierarchy. The block utilized for a potential checkpoint consensus is
the block associated with notarized transaction created by SIP30, and
in turn adds an additional layer of security. 

==Specification== 
The transactions created on the external blockchain are associated
with the following output script. 

"Bolo" Notarization Output Script: 

OP_RETURN &lt;&lt; OP_11 &lt;&lt; OP_1 &lt;&lt; OP_11 &lt;&lt;
OP_HASH160 &lt;&lt; OP_HASH256 &lt;&lt; OP_HASH256 &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;
OP_0 

The notarization script references the coin interface (literally
Hash160("shc")) as the OP_HASH160. 

The first OP_HASH256 is the hash of the SHC block that is being
notarized. 

The second OP_HASH256 is a merkle hash of the last 1000 blocks
prior to the notarized block. 

The height is a 4-byte "integer" of the block's height. 

The Shioncoin bolo interface will attempt to notarize any blocks
that have a OP_RETURN OP_0" output script suffix and have a coin
value equal to or less than 1 coin. This includes both no-output
matrix validation coinbase txs, notarized dynamic checkpoints txs, or
other arbitrary transactions. Validation matrix dynamic checkpoints
are created on the Shioncoin blockchain by several nodes providing a
multi-sig transaction verifying a validation matrix. 

When a bolo notary tx references a validation matrix notary tx, it
will in effect provides three layers of security in order to
establish blockchain integrity. Refer to SIP30 for more information
on dynamic checkpoints generated from validation matrix transactions.
After every 1000 blocks the block-chain is scanned for the first
null-output transaction as described above. Once the block height has
reached an offset of 20 blocks each participating node will submit a
transaction on the LTC blockchain that can be considered a proposal
to generate a notary transaction using the combined outputs. A bolo
litecoin transaction requires that at least eleven (11) nodes to be
in agreement with the proposed notary height and it's preceding 1000
blocks of transactions 

A notarized bolo transaction will not over-ride a locally
established dynamic checkpoint when the bolo transaction references
the same or lower height. Participating notaries publish a "bolo
proposal tx" on the litecoin block-chain. The first output
contains a 0.00001 coin output value to themselves. A second output
is a CScript ID of the final notarization output script with a zero
coin value. The potential notary endures tx fee to initiate the
transaction, and, for example, with a fee of 0.0001 ltc a total of
0.00011 LTC would be spent for the proposal tx submitted. 

A tx which includes all potential notaries is submitted, with a
lock time of 20 blocks, until at least eleven participants have
provided a signature for the transaction. The transaction will fail
after the lock time period if not enough signatures are gathered. A
transaction will not be committed to the blockchain until it's "lock
time" has elapsed. A final notarized transaction consists of the
described notary proposal outputs (which each contain 0.00001 ltc). 

When available notaries with eleven or more signatures has been
gathered, the final transaction is committed with the original lock
time and a "final sequence" marked for all inputs. A single
output is the full notarization output script with a zero coin value.

When the final notarized transaction is committed to the external
blockchain, a new dynamic checkpoint will be created on the shioncoin
blockchain for the block height of the original SHC block being
notarized. The individual inputs comprise the tx fee in order to
publish the transaction. For example, a transaction comprising of
eleven notaries would generate a 0.00011 LTC paid fee. 

The external blockchain transaction is composed of a
SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY input type. This is done in order to allow for
"signatures to be gathered" as nodes relay the notary
transaction with more compiled inputs. The inputs are sorted in a
manner so that the same transaction will be submitted regardless of
origin node [where all nodes see the same information]. Non-signed
inputs of participants are included until at least eleven signed
inputs are acquired. Only active participants which have already
committed a notary proposal on the external blockchain are considered
for inclusion in the final notarized transaction. 

==Rationale== 
This SIP provides a supplemental layer of verification derived
from the capabilities provided in SIP30; which itself derives from
the verification capabilities provided in SIP20. This intentional
"chained" design provides a robust method of verification
and integrity. 

==Backwards Compatibility== 
The transactions described in this SIP are an optional
implementation, and are expected to be available to the user as a
configuration option which is disabled by default. This "notary
participant" option, when enabled, will both generate the
initial proposal transactions on the external blockchain and the
subsequent signing process. No participation is required and none
will be taken without available funds in the litecoin service for the
"system" account name.
